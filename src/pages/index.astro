                        I had a great experience with Emmie Strassberg during my coaching sessions.
                        I went through 5 rounds of Intrauterine insemination and three rounds of In
                        vitro fertilization which resulted in one miscarriage and one successful
                        pregnancy. Emmie's support was crucial in the process. It was an emotional
                        experience and having a life coach was very helpful.

                          When I started pregnancy coaching with Dr. Emmie Strassberg, I wasn't sure
                          what to expect. I had just moved, was preparing for another baby, and felt
                          overwhelmed by how challenging pregnancy had been the first time around.
                          What stood out immediately was her unique perspective as a Maternal-Fetal
                          Medicine physician—she understood both the medical and emotional sides of
                          pregnancy and gave me practical tools to cope.

                        <em>
                          Her warmth and empathy filled in the gap that traditional prenatal care
                          often misses. Instead of just hearing "stress isn't good for pregnancy," I
                          learned how to actually manage it, reframe my thinking, and find more
                          peace. If you're considering pregnancy coaching with Dr. Strassberg, do
                          it—having someone who is both compassionate and a physician makes a world
                          of difference.
