In my work as a high risk pregnancy doctor, I regularly see women struggle with anxiety and uncertainty that come up during pregnancy. Past pregnancies, medical conditions, family circumstances, work and current pregnancy concerns can all be overwhelming at times.

            I had a great experience with Emmie Strassberg during my coaching sessions. I went
            through 5 rounds of Intrauterine insemination and three rounds of In vitro fertilization
            which resulted in one miscarriage and one successful pregnancy. Emmie's support was
            crucial in the process. It was an emotional experience and having a life coach was very
            helpful.
